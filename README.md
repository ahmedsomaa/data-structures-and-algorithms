# Data Structure & Algorithms

A repo that contains data structures and algorithms concepts and their implementations in TypeScript.

## Purpose

The aim of this repo is to help students study data structures and algorithms whether for a job, an interview...etc.

## Data Structures

A data structure is a way of organizing, managing, and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Data structures are crucial to creating fast and powerful algorithms, helping manage very large amounts of data, such as databases and internet indexing services. They are also essential for designing and maintaining various types of software, including operating systems, games, and networked applications.
